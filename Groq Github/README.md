# AI Agent Python

## Overview
This project is a simple AI assistant built with Python. It can answer any question using the [Groq Llama 3 API](https://console.groq.com/keys) and fetch public GitHub user info using the GitHub API. No OpenAI key or quota is requiredâ€”just a free Groq API key and a GitHub token.

## Key Features
- **Conversational AI:** Ask any question and get an answer from Llama 3 (via Groq).
- **GitHub Integration:** Type `github <username>` to get public info about any GitHub user.
- **Environment Configuration:** Uses `.env` for secure API key management.

## Ideal For
- Developers wanting a simple, extensible Python AI chatbot.
- Anyone looking for a free alternative to OpenAI for LLM-powered Q&A.
- Experimenting with Groq's Llama 3 API and GitHub API.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **AI/LLM:** Llama 3 via Groq API
- **API Integration:** GitHub REST API
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv

- Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:
  ```
  GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```
  *(Replace with your actual keys)*

### 4. Run the assistant
